# vju
Just another Vagrant file to get Juju running quickly, but this one is clean and ready to rumble in your host.

## Examples:
```
vju up                      => vagrant up
vju down                    => vagrant suspend
vju alias demo/0 demo.local => Will add something like '10.0.3.175  demo.local' at the end of /etc/hosts file.
```
